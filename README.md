# twitch-ripper
Download twitch clips and edit them together with the use of twitch-dl and ffmpeg
Requires twitch-dl and ffmpeg <br>

Currently for Windows but I plan on making a Linux version as well <br>
the current syntax is "py main.py (the channel you want to download from) (the number of clips)" <br>
I am planning on adding more argparse options, but thats something I'm going to get to later <br>
The video upload script is a modified version of https://github.com/SteBurz/youtube-uploader <br>
I solved the problem with duping frames, still need to implment the fix in TiKTokRipper
