# twitch-ripper
Download twitch clips and edit them together with the use of twitch-dl and ffmpeg
Requires twitch-dl and ffmpeg

Currently for Windows but I plan on making a Linux version as well
the current syntax is "py main.py (the channel you want to download from) (the number of clips)"
I am planning on adding argparse options and help page, but I need to figure out how to do that first
